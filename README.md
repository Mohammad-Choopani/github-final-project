Where:
- `p` is the principal amount
- `t` is the time period in years
- `r` is the annual rate of interest
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-final-project.git
2.Navigate to the directory containing the script
cd github-final-project
3.Make the script executable by running:
chmod +x simple-interest.sh
4.Run the script using:
./simple-interest.sh
5.Enter the required values when prompted for the principal, rate of interest, and time period.

Example Output:
